# LU_decomposition
Implementation of LU-decomposition of the matrix A with the choice of the leading element by column Also implemented the decomposition check and comparison of the matrices LU and PA, where P is the row permutation matrix.

Also, using the LU decomposition, were found:
- The determinant of the matrix A;
- System of linear equations solution Ax = b;
- Matrix A^(-1);
- Condition number of matrix A.
